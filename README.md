# SDEV140_FinalProject
Final Project for SDEV140 class
This project contains a tkinter Python GUI called "Sam's Discount Shoes".
It is a shoe shopping application where people can shop for shoes at a discounted price.
This program displays 8 pairs of shoes where you can select how many of each pair of shoe 
you would like to order. Once you have selected the amount of shoes you want, you can 
click the total button to calculate the price. Then you can click the order button
which will take you to a new window where you can input your personal information.
